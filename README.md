# Gaussian Normal Distribution Simulator

This C# project calculates the Gaussian normal distribution and simulates a software that makes decisions on when to play a move and when to play a series based on random inputs.

## Features

- Calculates the Gaussian normal distribution using mathematical formulas.

- Simulates a software that makes decisions on playing moves and series based on random inputs.
- Adjusts the frequency of moves and series based on the number of movies in the system.
- Provides customizable input parameters for simulation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the solution file (`GaussianNormalDistributionSimulator.sln`) in Visual Studio or any other C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to compile the code.
4. Run the application to execute the simulation.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Set the input parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and number of movies in the system.
3. Click the "Simulate" button to start the simulation.
4. Observe the output which displays the decision of playing a move or a series based on the calculated Gaussian normal distribution and the number of movies in the system.


## Acknowledgements

The implementation of Gaussian normal distribution calculation is based on [mathnet/numerics](https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics) library.
